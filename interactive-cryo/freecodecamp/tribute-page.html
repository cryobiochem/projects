           RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star
    Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of
    15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from
    Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and
    crew aboard, <b>more than 1,500 died</b>, making the sinking one of modern
    history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters.
    <br><br>
           RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service
    and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by
    the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard
    in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, chief naval architect of the shipyard
    at the time, died in the disaster.
    <br><br>
           Titanic was under the command of Capt. Edward Smith, <u>who also went down
    with the ship</u>. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people
    in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland,
    Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a
    new life in the United States.
