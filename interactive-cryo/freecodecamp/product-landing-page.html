      <br><br><br><h3>Meaning</h3>
      <p>Blue represents both the sky and the sea, and is associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, imagination, expansiveness, inspiration, and sensitivity. Blue also represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom,
        confidence, stability, faith, heaven, and intelligence.<br><br>

        The color blue has positive affects on the mind and the body. As the color of the spirit, it invokes rest and can cause the body to produce chemicals that are calming and exude feelings of tranquility. Blue helps to slow human metabolism, is
        cooling in nature, and helps with balance and self-expression. Blue is also an appetite suppressant.<br><br>

        However not all blues are serene and sedate. Electric or brilliant blues become dynamic and dramatic, an engaging color that expresses exhilaration. Also, some shades of blue or the use of too much blue may come across as cold or uncaring,
        and can dampen spirits.<br><br>

        Blue can be strong and steadfast or light and friendly. Blue is used to symbolize piety and sincerity in heraldry. The color blue in many cultures is significant in religious beliefs, brings peace, or is believed to keep the bad spirits away.
        In Iran, blue is the color of mourning while in the West the something blue bridal tradition represents love.<br><br>

        The blue color communicates significance, importance, and confidence without creating somber or sinister feelings. This is where the corporate blue power suit and the blue uniforms of police officers and firefighter came from. Considered a
        highly corporate color, blue is often associated with intelligence, stability, unity, and conservatism.<br><br>

        Too much blue can create feelings of melancholy, negativity, sadness, self-righteousness, and self-centeredness. Too little blue brings about qualities of suspicion, depression, stubbornness, timidity, and unreliability.</p>
