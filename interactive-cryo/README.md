### This is an outdated implementation of [my portfolio](https://streamlit.guerreiro.app), but was the initial prototyping idea.

Welcome to *Interactive Cryo*, the first HTML/CSS project by Bruno Guerreiro. 
This repository contains code for a web application that gamifies biophysics, 
focusing on polymer biophysics in cryopreservation. This project serves as a sample 
portfolio landing page developed as part of the Web Responsive Design course on freeCodeCamp.
